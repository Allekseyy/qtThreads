# qtThreads
My take on a test task using multithreating (under constrution)

## The task
- Create 2 threads from main thread; 
- The first thread starts and appends "1" to QString. 
- The second thread starts after the first one and appends "2" to QString.
- Print the modified QString from the main thread;
